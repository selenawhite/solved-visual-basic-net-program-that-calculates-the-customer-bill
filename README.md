(The Convention is about Twentieth Century American Literature.) They need a special program to expedite the sale of novels they are featuring.

Students at the College (15%)

Faculty (20%)

College Staff Members (10%)

Other New Jersey College Students (10%)

In addition, you must include NJ tax in your calculations (6%), except for Faculty members, who pay no tax on class books.
